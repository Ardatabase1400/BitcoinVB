 Bitcoin functions for VB6
 
 This repository contains secp256k1 library adapted for VB6. It also contains the small hashing library which provides RIPEMD-160/SHA256 hashing algorithm adapted for VB6. As a simple example there is a VB6 code which allows to generate keys/address for the Bitcoin (BTC) network. You can then import such keys to a wallet.
